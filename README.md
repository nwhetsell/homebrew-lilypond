# homebrew-lilypond

This was a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for installing [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org) on macOS. You should install [LilyPond from homebrew/core](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lilypond) instead of this tap.

```sh
brew ls --formula --full-name | grep '^nwhetsell/lilypond/' | xargs brew uninstall

```

After youâ€™ve untapped this tap, you can reinstall LilyPond by running:

```
